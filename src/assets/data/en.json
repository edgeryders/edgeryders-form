    "body": "Our theory of change is building dense networks around people trying to tackle messy socialecological, economic and political challenges. Having a dense network around you is one of the hallmarks of social capital, and gives you access to expertise, resources, skill sharing and financing. In a dense network, there are many ways for you to get from one point to another. A key challenge here is for people with aligned interests to find each other, and as a community we’re out to solve just that.<br/><br/>To do this we organise seminars, workshops, hackathons, retreats, Labs, research collaborations & build exciting projects where we put what we learn into practice.<br/><br/>This form is a tool to help you register and make the most of the event.
